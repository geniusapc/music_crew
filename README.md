## Project Setup

1. This project assumes you have [NodeJS v10](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed.

2. You should also have [npm v6](https://www.npmjs.com/) or greater installed as well (this comes packaged
   with Node 8).

3. You'll also need a recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
   as well.

4. You have to install [mongoDb](https://mongodb.com/) so that you can access database.

5. You have to install [redis](https://redis.io)

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` on the project root directory and type the following
   gmailUser=<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
   gmailPass=<YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD>
   REDIS_URL=<REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING> <!-- omit if you have redis installed locally on your computer -->
   MONGODB_URI=<MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING> <!-- omit if you have mongodb driver installed locally on your computer -->

2) Start the server locally by running `npm run dev` making sure you are on the project root directory; the server will then start on `http://localhost:8000/graphql`
